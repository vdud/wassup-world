# Open-Source Realtime Chat-App,

I am very excited about metaverse, so I created this app with Svelte JS framework,
if you know how to use svelte, then please join on my journey to make this the only social media app one person need to have,
It is going to be coders focus app, so content creators should be coders,
It is going to serve all the local businesses, like NightClubs, Restaurants, Cafes...etc
I want to integrate it with crypto currency and payment system so, users can easily transfer crypto to friend on the go, and can be anon.

## Want to try it out?

Once you've downloaded the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

### start it on localhost.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

### or start the server and host it for mobile.

```bash
npm run dev --host
```

Just take look at env.d.ts so you can generate your own api for testing and development,

> 2. Pusher-Realtime,
> 3. Google Places Api.
